**This article is for Demo purpose**

The article was originally on [this repo](https://github.com/risan/risanb.com/blob/master/content/posts/react-component-with-dot-notation/index.md)

This is my answer to someone's question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49256472/react-how-to-extend-a-component-that-has-child-components-and-keep-them/49258038#answer-49258038). How can we define a React component that is accessible through the dot notation?

Take a look at the following code. We have the `Menu` component and its three children `Menu.Item`:

```jsx
const App = () => (
  <Menu>
    <Menu.Item>Home</Menu.Item>
    <Menu.Item>Blog</Menu.Item>
    <Menu.Item>About</Menu.Item>
  </Menu>
);
```
